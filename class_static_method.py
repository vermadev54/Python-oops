    ##class variable ##
    # A class method is a method which is bound to the class and not the object of the class.
    # It can modify a class state that would apply across all the instances of the class. 
      For example it can modify a class variable that will be applicable to all the instances.
    # shared among all instance of class.
    # are same for all instance (same value)
    # people call alternative constructor(example: from_string)
    # from_string : suppose we are getting the employee details in string format
      ("raju-kumar-7000") to create employee from string after split.
    # A class method takes cls as first parameter while a static method needs no specific parameters.
    # A class method can access or modify class state while a static method canâ€™t access or modify it.
    # In general, static methods know nothing about class state.
      They are utility type methods that take some parameters and work upon those parameters.
      On the other hand class methods must have class as parameter.
    # We generally use class method to create factory methods. 
      Factory methods return class object ( similar to a constructor ) for different use cases.
      We generally use static methods to create utility functions.

    ## Static Method ##
    # A static method is also a method which is bound to the class and not the object of the class.
    # A static method is also a method which is bound to the class and not the object of the class.

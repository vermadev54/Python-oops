Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from some another class. The benefits of inheritance are:

    1. It represents real-world relationships well.
    2. It provides reusability of a code. We donâ€™t have to write the same code again and again. Also,
       it allows us to add more features to a class without modifying it.
    3. It is transitive in nature, which means that if class B inherits from another class A,
       then all the subclasses of B would automatically inherit from class A.
